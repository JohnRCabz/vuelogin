### Coding Practices
State Management
We use Pinia for state management. The state is defined in the taskStore located at taskStore.js. This store manages the tasks and provides actions to add, toggle, and delete tasks.

Component-Based Architecture
The project follows a component-based architecture. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI. For example, the Navbar component is located at Navbar.vue, and the main application layout is defined in App.vue.

Routing
We use Vue Router for navigation between different views. The routes are defined in index.js. The application has three main routes: TaskList, CompletedTasks, and Login.

Styling
We use Tailwind CSS for styling. The Tailwind CSS configuration is defined in tailwind.config.js, and the main stylesheet is located at tailwind.css.

Scoped Styles
We use scoped styles in Vue components to ensure that styles are applied only to the component they are defined in. This helps in avoiding style conflicts and makes the components more modular.

Local Storage
Tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage. The taskStore handles saving and loading tasks from local storage to ensure that the tasks are retained even after a page refresh.

Form Handling and Validation
The login form in LoginPage.vue uses Vue's reactive properties to handle form input and validation. The CAPTCHA is generated and validated on the client side to enhance security.

Responsive Design
The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes. Tailwind CSS utility classes are used to ensure that the layout adapts to various devices.

Code Quality
We follow best practices for code quality, including:

Using meaningful variable and function names.
Keeping components small and focused on a single responsibility.
Using Vue's composition API for better code organization and reusability.
Writing modular and reusable code.
Version Control
We use Git for version control. The .gitignore file is configured to exclude unnecessary files and directories such as node_modules, build artifacts, and local environment files.

Browser Compatibility
The project is configured to support modern browsers as specified in the .browserslistrc file. This ensures that the application works consistently across different browsers.

Configuration
The project configuration is managed through various configuration files such as jsconfig.json, postcss.config.js, and tailwind.config.js. These files help in setting up the development environment and build process.
